# How to set up ODK Collect


The Bohemia project uses "ODK" (Open Data Kit), a suite of open-source software tools optimized for questionnaire-based data collection in low-connectivity settings. The android/tablet app for data collection is called "ODK Collect". This guide explains how to install it.

## Installation

- Get an android device and an internet connection.
- Scan the below QR code

- Click "Install"


## Configuration

Now you need to associate your device with the project's server. In order to do so:

- Open "ODK Collect"
- Click "Configure with QR code"
- Scan the QR code provided to you by the project
- After scanning the QR code, you are ready to begin collecting data

(As an example, click [here](img/recontesting.png) for a QR code which will allow you to test the "recon" forms)

## Data collection
